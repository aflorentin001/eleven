## Application Summary

The AI Story Voice Generator is a web-based application that combines OpenAI's language generation capabilities with ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology to create an immersive storytelling experience.

Users begin by entering a story idea or prompt into a text field on the main interface. Upon clicking "Generate Story," the application leverages OpenAI's API to create a complete, creative narrative based on the user's input. The generated story appears in a clean, readable format on the page.

Once the story is generated, users can click "Generate Voice" to convert the written text into natural-sounding speech using ElevenLabs' voice synthesis technology. The application provides intuitive playback controls including Play and Stop buttons, along with status indicators showing whether the audio is playing or paused.

The interface features a modern, user-friendly design with a clean layout highlighting three key features: AI-Powered storytelling with OpenAI, Voice Generation with natural voice synthesis from ElevenLabs, and Instant Results delivering stories in seconds. Users can also clear their current story and start over with the "Clear & Start Over" button.

- `npm run build` - Build for production (if applicable)
- `npm run lint` - Run code quality checks

## API Rate Limits and Considerations

### OpenAI API
- Rate limits vary by plan (Free tier has lower limits)
- Story generation typically uses 500-1500 tokens per request
- Monitor usage to stay within quota
- Consider implementing caching for frequently requested prompts

### ElevenLabs API
- Free tier: 10,000 characters per month
- Paid tiers offer higher limits
- Voice generation counts against monthly quota
- Consider optimizing story length for API efficiency

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
4. **Validate user input** before sending to APIs
5. **Handle errors gracefully** without exposing API details
6. **Use HTTPS** for all API communications

## Future Enhancements
